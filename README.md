 Lightning Exercise:
 Create a new console app
 In that app, create a new class called "Album"
 Create a Property called Name that is gettable and settable
 create a field on the Album class called "_downloaded" of type bool
 create a method on the Album class called Play. If the album is downloaded, write to the console that the album is playing,
